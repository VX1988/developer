<!-- Welcome to Rust programming cheetsheet section.  

This is my website dedicated to archiving and sharing various software development code snippets.

I got tired of re-writing the same code over and over so I ended up making a private repository of code snippets to easily copy-paste. I decided to share it publicly because I think other people might find it helpful too.

As the code base grew, I decided to migrate it to here. I think it will make it easier to find code segments.
